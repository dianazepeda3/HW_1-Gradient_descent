    "# Theory on the Gradient Descent algorithm\n",
    "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm is used to find the minimun of a function using the negative gradient by iteratively moving in the direction of the steepest descent.\n",
    "It updates parameters using the rule:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w_{t+1} = w_t - n_t * ∇f(w_t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $w_{t+1}$ represents the parameters, $n_t$ is the learning rate, and $∇f(w_t)$ is the gradient of the cost function. \n",
    "The process continues until convergence, which is determined by a stopping criterion such as a small gradient magnitude or a predefined number of iterations.\n",
    "## What is the learning rate?\n",
    "The learning rate $n$ is the size of the steps that are taken to reach the minimum. \n",
    "* A **high learning rate may cause the algorithm to overshoot the minimum, leading to divergence.\n",
    "* A **low** learning rate would slow convergece, it has more precision but the number of iterations compromises the efficiency."
